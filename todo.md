general exceptions are always in xml, how to make these follow content-type?

order of attribs would be nice

timestamps for created and last updated for domains,users,roles and grants 

length checking on all attribs being POSTED or PUT 

DELETE of domain or user needs to verify that it is not referenced in the grant table

supress password on all responses
